# Password Strength Checker

## Overview

This Python tool assesses the strength of a password based on various criteria such as length, character types, and complexity. It also estimates the time it would take for an attacker to crack the password using brute force techniques. If the password is deemed weak, the tool generates a stronger password for the user.
